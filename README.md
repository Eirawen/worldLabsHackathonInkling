# Marble Muse — The World That Listens

> Generate once with Marble. Edit forever through conversation. Every world you touch makes every future world richer.

**Marble Muse** is a real-time, language-driven editing layer for Marble's gaussian splat worlds. You walk through a 3D world in your browser, click on things, talk to them, and they change. Remove objects, shift the atmosphere, relight the scene, extract assets into a reusable library, and composite elements across worlds — all through natural conversation with an AI that understands 3D space.

Built on **Spark** (World Labs' open-source gaussian splat renderer) and powered by **Gemini** for spatial reasoning, Marble Muse turns Marble's 6-minute generation cycle into a real-time creative loop.

---

## The Problem

Marble generates stunning 3D worlds from text and images. But iteration is slow — every change requires a full regeneration (~6 minutes). There is no way to make targeted edits, adjust lighting, remove objects, or remix worlds after generation. The creative feedback loop is broken.

## The Solution

Marble Muse adds a **real-time editing layer** that operates directly on Marble's gaussian splat output. Instead of regenerating, you **converse** with your world:

- *"Remove that tree."* → It vanishes instantly.
- *"Make this a sunset scene."* → Warm golden light floods the environment.
- *"Turn the building facade to red brick."* → Color shifts in real-time.
- *"Add a spotlight on the fountain."* → Volumetric light cone appears.
- *"Take that lamppost and save it."* → Extracted to your asset library for reuse in any scene.

No regeneration. No waiting. 60fps in the browser.

## How It Works

### Core Pipeline

1. **Load** — Marble .spz file loaded via Spark's `SplatMesh({ url })` into a Three.js scene
2. **Index** — `forEachSplat()` builds a 20×20×20 spatial voxel grid over the cropped bounding box. Each occupied cell stores centroid, splat count, average color, density, and bounding extents
3. **Understand** — Multi-angle screenshots + voxel grid JSON fed to Gemini vision to generate a semantic scene manifest (one-time, cached)
4. **Interact** — User clicks (Spark's built-in `raycast()`) to select a region, then types a natural language command
5. **Reason** — Gemini receives: scene manifest + click position + voxel cell data + current camera screenshot + user command. Outputs structured JSON describing SplatEdit SDF operations
6. **Execute** — JSON parsed into Spark `SplatEdit` + `SplatEditSdf` objects (spheres, boxes, cones, planes). Applied on the GPU in real-time at 60fps
7. **Extract** — On delete operations, splats in the affected region are simultaneously extracted via `forEachSplat()`, filtered (by color coherence, density, opacity), normalized, and saved as reusable `PackedSplats` assets in the library
8. **Reuse** — Assets from the library can be placed into any scene via click-to-place + `pushSplat()`
9. **Swap Worlds** — Press `Esc` to open the world hub, pick another world node, and keep using the same extracted asset library across worlds

### Edit Operations (via Spark SplatEdit SDF System)

| Operation | Blend Mode | SDF Config | Effect |
|-----------|-----------|------------|--------|
| **Delete** | `MULTIPLY` | `opacity: 0` | Splats in region become invisible |
| **Recolor** | `SET_RGB` | `color: [r, g, b]` | Splats in region change color |
| **Light (additive)** | `ADD_RGBA` | `color: [r, g, b]` | Adds light/color to region |
| **Darken** | `MULTIPLY` | `color: [0.3, 0.3, 0.3]` | Multiplies color down in region |
| **Atmosphere** | `MULTIPLY` / `ADD_RGBA` | Multiple overlapping SDFs | Global mood/tone shift |

All operations support: `softEdge` (feathered boundaries), `sdfSmooth` (blending between shapes), and compound shapes (multiple SDFs per operation for complex regions).

### SDF Shape Primitives

`SPHERE` · `BOX` · `ELLIPSOID` · `CYLINDER` · `CAPSULE` · `PLANE` · `INFINITE_CONE` · `ALL`

These map naturally to spatial editing concepts: spheres for point selections, boxes for architectural regions, cones for spotlights, planes for ground/sky splits.

## Demo Script (60 seconds)

1. **[0:00]** Open the app. A Marble-generated city scene loads in the browser.
2. **[0:10]** Click on a parked car. Type: *"Remove this."* Car vanishes instantly. "The car is now in our asset library."
3. **[0:20]** Type: *"Make this a golden hour scene."* Warm orange light washes over the entire world via compound SDF lighting edits.
4. **[0:30]** Click on a building. Type: *"Make this red brick."* Building facade recolors in real-time.
5. **[0:40]** Open the asset library sidebar. Click the extracted car. Click a spot in a SECOND Marble scene loaded in a tab. Car appears in the new scene.
6. **[0:50]** *"Marble generates worlds in 6 minutes. We make them editable in real-time, through conversation, in the browser. Every edit builds your library. Every world makes the next one richer."*
7. **[0:60]** Title card: **Marble Muse — The World That Listens.**

## Key Insight

Marble's gaussian splats are data, not pixels. Spark exposes that data through a programmable SDF editing pipeline that runs on the GPU. By placing an LLM between the user's intent and Spark's SDF system, we turn natural language into spatial operations — and we do it at 60fps with zero regeneration.

**We didn't build a project. We built the editing layer Marble needs to ship next.**

## Prior Art & Differentiation

| Approach | Method | Speed | Our Advantage |
|----------|--------|-------|--------------|
| **GaussianEditor** (CVPR 2024) | Diffusion + backprop optimization | ~20 min/edit on V100 | We're real-time, browser-based, no GPU training |
| **Instruct-NeRF2NeRF** | NeRF + InstructPix2Pix | 45 min–2 hrs | We operate on splats, not NeRFs. Instant. |
| **Marble (native)** | Full regeneration | ~6 min | We edit without regenerating |
| **Marble Muse (ours)** | LLM → SDF edits on GPU | **< 3 seconds** | Real-time, conversational, composable |

## Setup

```bash
git clone <repo>
cd marble-muse
npm install
npm run dev
```

Set `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY` in `.env` for primary Gemini access.
Optional failover: set `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY` (and optionally `VITE_OPENAI_MODEL`, default `gpt-5.2`) to enable automatic fallback when Gemini is temporarily unavailable (for example HTTP 503 high demand).

Place `.spz` files exported from Marble in `public/scenes/`.
Configure world hub nodes in `public/scenes/worlds.json`.
