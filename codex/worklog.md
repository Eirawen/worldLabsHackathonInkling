<!-- Entries will be added here as work progresses -->
[2026-02-27] [AGENT] [T01,T02,T03] — Completed foundation scaffold + Spark viewer + SplatEdit spike wiring. Added `src/main.ts`, finalized `src/viewer.ts` (camera fit from bounding box, SparkRenderer, OrbitControls, click raycast with wireframe indicator, screenshot helper, callback unsubscribe), copied Marble test scene to `public/scenes/elegant_library_with_fireplace_500k.spz`, and added hardcoded delete/recolor/additive `SplatEdit` spike tests with softEdge + timed removal/restore log. `npm run build` passes. `npm run dev` could not be runtime-verified in this environment because sandbox blocks opening a local listening port (`listen EPERM`). 
[2026-02-27] [AGENT] [TESTS] — Started unit test suite by extracting spike helper math/formatting into `src/spike-utils.ts` and adding `tests/spike-utils.test.ts` (fallback anchor behavior, bounds-derived anchor placement, radius clamping, point formatting). Added `vitest` scripts/dependency to `package.json` (dependency install/runtime not verified in sandbox).
[2026-02-27] [AGENT] [T05,T06] — Added `src/types.ts` with shared interfaces (VoxelCell/SpatialGrid/SceneManifest/EditOperation/etc.) and implemented `src/spatial-index.ts` (20x20x20 voxel grid build from `SplatMesh.forEachSplat()`, Y-crop fallback, per-cell stats, queries, LLM serialization). Wired minimal spatial index logging into `src/main.ts` and added `tests/spatial-index.test.ts` for crop/grid mapping/query/serialization helpers. `npm run build` passes. `npm test` currently fails (`vitest: not found`) because `npm install` cannot fetch registry in this environment (`EAI_AGAIN`).
[2026-02-27] [AGENT] [UX] — Added keyboard movement to `src/viewer.ts`: WASD horizontal movement, Q/E vertical movement, and Shift speed boost. Movement translates both `camera.position` and `OrbitControls.target` each frame so OrbitControls remains usable while navigating the scene. `npm run build` passes.
[2026-02-28] [AGENT] [T07] — Implemented `src/agent.ts` Claude command pipeline with a high-precision Spark SDF system prompt, multimodal request assembly, Anthropic Sonnet API wrapper (`anthropic-dangerous-direct-browser-access` header, temperature 0), markdown/JSON parsing fallback, strict runtime operation/shape validation + normalization, and single-retry error handling. Added `buildClickContext()` with compact click/primary-cell/neighbor summaries. Enforced delete safety defaults (`extractAsset: true`, generated `assetLabel` fallback). Logged outcomes/errors with `[agent]` prefix and included command/op counts. Saved full prompt verbatim to `codex/agent-system-prompt.md`.
[2026-02-28] [AGENT] [T07-TEST/HARDEN] — Hardened `src/agent.ts` and added `tests/agent.test.ts` (8 tests) covering: system prompt presence checks, `buildClickContext()` formatting, raw JSON parsing, markdown-wrapped JSON parsing, retry-then-success behavior, retry exhaustion failures, Anthropic header/body correctness, and delete normalization behavior. Hardening changes include screenshot base64 normalization (supports `data:image/...;base64,...`), action→blend canonicalization safety, and forced `opacity: 0` for delete shapes. Full suite now passes (`npm test`: 20/20 tests, `npm run build` passes).
[2026-02-27] [AGENT] [T05,T06,T10] — Finalized data layer: (1) Verified `src/types.ts` has all 7 AGENTS.md interfaces complete. (2) Improved `src/spatial-index.ts`: added default `radius=1` to `getNeighborCells`, improved `serializeSpatialGridForLLM` to skip cells with <10 splats, round to 2 decimals, use hex color strings, include cell dimensions, use compact JSON keys for smaller payload. (3) Created `src/scene-manifest.ts` with color/height heuristic labeling (sky, vegetation, ground, structure, shadow, etc.), 6-connected flood-fill connected-component grouping into `SemanticRegion` objects, natural language description generation, and `getManifestJSON` for compact serialization. (4) Updated `src/main.ts` to call `generateManifest()` after `buildSpatialGrid()`, log manifest description/region count, and store grid+manifest in module-level state with exported getters for future modules. `npm run build` passes cleanly (tsc + vite). Runtime timing and cell count stats pending browser verification.
[2026-02-28] [AGENT] [T08,T09] — Implemented end-to-end edit pipeline wiring for MVP. Added `src/executor.ts` with full `EditOperation[]` -> Spark `SplatEdit`/`SplatEditSdf` translation, explicit blend/type enum mapping, conditional shape field assignment (including optional opacity handling), scoped-vs-global parent heuristic (`atmosphere` and `light+ALL`), and undo stack APIs (`undoLastEdit`, `undoAllEdits`, `getEditHistory`) with optional disposal. Added `src/ui.ts` chat interface (`#muse-chat-container`) with message log, status text, send and undo controls, toast notifications, Enter send, Ctrl/Cmd+Z undo, and full runtime pipeline integration (`processCommand` + click/grid/manifest/screenshot context + `executeOperations`). Refactored `src/main.ts` to remove all T03 spike edit code/imports, keep viewer->spatial->manifest bootstrap, track/export module-level `lastClickPoint`, and initialize UI via dependency injection. Updated `src/styles.css` with chat/toast styles while preserving existing `#canvas` and `#info`. Validation: `npm run build` passes and `npm test` passes (67/67).
[2026-02-28] [AGENT] [T08,T09-HARDEN] — Hardened MVP integration against spec details: updated `src/executor.ts` to use safer SDF color/displace assignment and robust scene-ancestor resolution for global operations (atmosphere / light+ALL). Updated `src/ui.ts` to remove input-focused Ctrl/Cmd+Z bypass (undo now consistently maps to edit undo), normalize screenshot payload before calling agent, and clean unused imports. Re-validated with `npm run build` and `npm test` (all passing).
[2026-02-28] [AGENT] [GEMINI-MIGRATION] — Migrated command pipeline from Anthropic Claude to Google Gemini Flash 3 (`gemini-3-flash-preview`) via official `@google/genai` SDK. Updated `src/agent.ts` transport layer to `GoogleGenAI().models.generateContent(...)` with multimodal contents and `systemInstruction`, preserved existing prompt + JSON parse/validation/retry behavior, and added candidate-part fallback text extraction when `response.text` is absent. Switched UI key source to `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY` in `src/ui.ts`. Reworked `tests/agent.test.ts` to mock `@google/genai` instead of `fetch` and assert Gemini request shape/config. Updated provider/env-var documentation in `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `TODO.md`. Added dependency `@google/genai` to project dependencies. Validation: `npm run build` passes and `npm test` passes (68/68).
